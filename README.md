# Hi, I'm Nakshatra 👋

### Builder | Problem Solver | Early Stage Engineer

I am a builder who enjoys turning vague ideas into working products. I care about **execution over perfection**, learning quickly from feedback, and building things that solve real problems.

I’m most comfortable in environments where ownership matters, iteration is fast, and impact is visible.

---

## 🚀 What I Care About

- Building products that are **useful, simple, and outcome-driven**
- Learning fast by **shipping, breaking, and improving**
- Taking ownership instead of waiting for instructions
- Understanding the *why* behind problems before jumping to solutions
- Working with people who value clarity, honesty, and momentum

---

## 🧠 How I Approach Building

- Start with the **user problem**, not the tech stack
- Build the **simplest viable version**
- Iterate based on feedback and real usage
- Refactor only when it improves clarity or velocity
- Prefer readable, maintainable solutions over clever abstractions

## 🚧 Current Project

### **ThinkFlow**

**ThinkFlow** is a learning platform designed to help developers **build strong problem solving logic through step by step DSA practice**.

Instead of focusing only on solutions, ThinkFlow emphasizes:
- Breaking problems into **logical steps**
- Reinforcing patterns through **deliberate practice**
- Helping learners move from *knowing syntax* to *thinking like engineers*

The platform is aimed at learners preparing for **software roles at tech giants as well as early stage startups**, where strong fundamentals and clear thinking matter.

**What I’m building & learning through ThinkFlow:**
- Designing learning flows that reduce cognitive overload
- Translating abstract DSA concepts into practical intuition
- Building features incrementally based on learner needs
- Balancing product thinking with solid engineering foundations

## 🛠️ Technical Foundation

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++
- **Frameworks & Tools:** React, Node.js, Express, Git, Docker
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Core Strengths:**  
  Data Structures & Algorithms, API Design, Object-Oriented Programming

I treat technology as a **means to ship better products faster**, not the goal itself.

## 🌱 Currently Improving

- Building end to end products independently
- Writing clearer, more maintainable code
- Understanding system trade-offs and constraints
- Communicating technical decisions more effectively
